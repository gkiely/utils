Todo:
- Setup isEqual and isEqualExtended
  - isEqual supports JSON
  - isEqualExtended also supports regex, functions, dates, cross context
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15745427/how-do-you-check-if-an-object-is-a-regular-expression-across-v8-contexts
- Setup a benchmark script against JSON.stringify

- Setup a benchmark script that runs all fast-deep-equals tests and fast-equals
- Send to Ray and another couple of people to double check
- Set up a test case for JSON.stringify
- Push to twitter

Then:
- Get it smaller than fast-deep-equal
- Move from tsdx to your own custom vite build that only outputs esm/ES6
- Add bundle size and performance table
  - Bundle size: 
  - Performance: 5.5x faster than lodash

## isEqual - performance
utils:
lodash:
nanoEqual: 

## isEqual - bundle size
utils:
lodash:
nanoEqual:
