Todo:
- Setup a benchmark script that runs all fast-deep-equals tests and fast-equals
- Push to twitter

Then:
- Get it smaller than fast-deep-equal
- Move from tsdx to your own custom vite build that only outputs esm/ES6
- Add bundle size and performance table
  - Bundle size: 
  - Performance: 5.5x faster than lodash

## isEqual - performance
utils:
lodash:
nanoEqual: 

## isEqual - bundle size

lodash:
nanoEqual:
